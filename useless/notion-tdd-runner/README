Tl;dr: Continuously run a script on a fixed location and report
its status in the statusbar.

Generate a trivial script that runs unit tests for a specific
project and then have notion's statusd facility run it every 10
seconds and report the status. The workflow idea is to activate
it when you starting hacking on a project and have it run while
your developing. If you leave for another project, you'll just
generate a new tdd-runner and continue hacking. When done, you
just 

This distribution contains the statusd script (written iin lua,
requires lua's posix module) and a helper script that can
generate the so called "tdd runners" (currently only for
ExtUtils::Makemaker based projects though). It can also
deactivate (remove) it.

The script location is ~/.notion/tdd-runner. It must be
executable and have a shebang line (or be a binary, whatever).
